## Objectives

- Validate critical business workflows across the Admin Dashboard.
- Ensure application stability through automated regression testing.
- Support Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) using Gherkin syntax.
- Enable cross-browser and parallel test execution.
- Integrate seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines.

## Technology Stack

- Playwright
- Cucumber (BDD)
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Gherkin
- GitHub Actions
- Jenkins (Optional)
